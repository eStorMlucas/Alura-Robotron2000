> The concept is to build the **Robotron 2000**, a war robot created to protect the earth against aliens and there's is some logical defiance to build the robot with their equipments, because all of them has particular stats that can increase or decrease the **Robotron 2000** overall stats.

## My Changes 

- ### Code changes 
    - I have changed the Main.js ManipulaDados() funcionality to be able to identify the piece alterated 
            to display the piece value and to be able to acess the object of the piece and change the overall
            stats of robotron.
            
    - I implemented an arrow function to change the color of the robot when the user click's in the image.
